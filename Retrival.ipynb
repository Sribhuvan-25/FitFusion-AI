      "Based on the documents, a good workout routine for children should include several hours of activity each day. This doesn't have to be structured exercise like going to a gym, but can include playing on a playground or going for walks. For children who are more serious athletes, they could try exercises from a calisthenics routine which includes knee lifts, squats, push-ups, and lunges. They should aim to do 8-12 repetitions of each exercise, starting with one set and gradually increasing to three sets as they gain strength. Resting for 30-90 seconds between sets can help with recovery. However, it's essential to ensure that exercise does not consume all their time and lead to burnout. Exercise should be a part of their routine, but not at the expense of other essential activities like eating and sleeping.\n",

      "Based on the documents provided, a healthy diet plan for older people should emphasize natural, unprocessed foods. The Mediterranean style diet is often recommended as it includes minimally processed fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains, with moderate amounts of yogurt, cheese, poultry, and fish. Olive oil is the primary cooking fat and red meat and added sugars are eaten sparingly. The DASH diet is also beneficial as it is low in cholesterol and saturated fats and high in magnesium, calcium, fiber, and potassium. It also includes whole grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry, nuts, and olive oil. A healthy diet also includes a good balance of nutrients, plenty of plant-based foods, low sugar and salt, and healthy fats. It's important to remember, the best diet is one that can be maintained in the long term, and it's always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new diet plan.\n",
