How cold affects muscles,"When the mercury drops, it threatens your body's core temperature, which functions best at about 98.6° F. To stay warm, your body will send more blood toward your core. ""The muscles in your legs and arms get less blood flow — and less oxygen — than they would in warmer temperatures. With less oxygen, the muscles are stiffer, they don't work as well, and they fatigue easily,"" says Dr. Sarah Eby, a sports medicine physician with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Cold weather also affects nerves (which contribute to muscle function) and makes blood flow to muscles even less efficient. All of these changes increase the risk for muscle and tendon injuries, especially if you're less active in the winter and your muscles are weak and tight."
Two types of stretches,"Dr. Eby recommends two kinds of stretches to ward off cold weather consequences. Dynamic stretches get your muscles ready for activity. They consist of flowing, repetitive motions, such as walking briskly. The activity sends blood, heat, and oxygen to the muscles to help them work more efficiently and make them less likely to tear. During winter, they're best done when you're inside. Most of the year, you need just a few minutes of dynamic stretching before an activity, and you might focus only on muscles you'll be using (such as leg muscles before a walk). ""But in cold weather, everything tightens up, and you need a dynamic warm-up for your whole body. Do lunges or squats, bring each knee to your chest, make circles with your arms, and twist your trunk left and right. Loosen up for about 10 to 15 minutes,"" Dr. Eby says. Static stretches keep muscles long and flexible and should be done only when your muscles are warmed up (after a workout, for example). To do a static stretch, you hold a certain position for 20 to 30 seconds, without bouncing (which can tear muscle fibers). Examples include Static stretches feel good and lengthen the muscles, which fights stiffness, increases your range of motion, and improves your posture, balance, and agility. Dr. Eby recommends doing them every day as a preventive measure or to relieve pain and stiffness. For more information about stretching, check out the Harvard Special Health ReportStretching."
What else you can do,"While stretching might be enough to avoid stiff winter muscles, the following tips can also help. Stay hydrated.This helps prevent lactic acid from building up in your muscles and causing cramps. Dress for the elements.""Dress warmly, with a hat, a neck gaiter, and a vest or a coat, so you don't need to shunt as much blood away from your arms and legs,"" Dr. Eby says. Take vitamin D3.Vitamin D deficiency can make muscles sore and achy. Take 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D3per day. Avoid junk food.Stay away from highly processed foods, such as cookies, chips, and frozen dinners. These can contribute to inflammation throughout the body, causing muscle discomfort."
If pain doesn't go away,"If muscle pain doesn't go away, you might have an injury, such as a muscle strain. An important clue: ""Sore muscles feel better once you loosen up and exercise. Strained muscles get worse as you keep going,"" Dr. Eby says. She recommends putting an ice pack on suspected muscle strains, applying topical pain relievers, and seeing your doctor if symptoms persist."
Why is exercise so important for seniors?,"Whether you were once much more physically active or have never been one to exercise regularly, now is a great time to start an exercise and fitness regimen. Getting and staying in shape is just as important for seniors as it is for younger people. Why is exercise important for older people? Getting your heart rate up and challenging your muscles benefits virtually every system in your body and improves your physical and mental health in myriad ways. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy blood pressure, keeps harmful plaque from building up in your arteries, reduces inflammation, improves blood sugar levels, strengthens bones, and helps stave offdepression. In addition, a regular exercise program can make your sex life better, lead to better quality sleep, reduce your risk of some cancers, and is linked to longer life. Many older adults hesitate to get moving because they’re unfamiliar with thetypes of exerciseand fitness that are effective and safe, and aren’t sure how much exercise they need to do. The good news is that any kind of movement is better than being sedentary, so there’s nothing wrong with starting small and working your way up to longer workouts. Your goal should be no less than 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week, but if you can’t start at that level, work up to it (and then past it). While there are many dedicated forms of exercise and fitness for adults, you also want to stay physically active throughout the day by taking the stairs, doing yard work, and playing with your grandkids. When it comes to exercise and fitness for seniors, most can begin without consulting a doctor—but there are exceptions. If you have a major health condition likediabetes, high blood pressure, heart or lung disease,osteoprosisor a neurological disease, definitely talk to your doctor first. People with mobility issues such as poor balance or arthritis should also get advice from their doctor. "
What are the best types of exercise?,"While there are endless forms ofexercise, experts categorize physical activity into four broad types based on what each calls upon your body to do and how the movement benefits you. Aerobic exercise is marked by an increased heart rate. Although most aerobic exercises require you to move your whole body, the main focus is on your heart and lungs (Aerobic exercise is often called “cardio” because it challenges and benefits your cardiovascular system). Activities like walking, swimming, dancing and cycling, if done at sufficient intensity, get you breathing faster and your heart working harder. Aerobic exercises burn fat, improve your mood, reduce inflammation and lower blood sugar. Strength training, sometimes called resistance training, should be performed two to three times a week. Squats, lunges, push-ups and the exercises performed on resistance machines or using weights or bands help maintain and even build muscle mass and strength. Strength training also helps prevent falls, keep bones strong, lower blood sugar levels, and improve balance. Do a combination of both isometric and isotonic exercises. Isometric exercises, such as doing planks and holding leg lifts, are done without movement. They are great for maintaining strength and improving stability. Isotonic exercises require you to bear weight throughout a range of motion. Bicep curls, bench presses and sit-ups are all forms of isotonic exercise. Stretching exerciseskeep your muscles and tendons flexible, preserve your posture, and improve mobility, especially as you age. Stretching can be done every day. Balance exercises call on the various systems that help you stay upright and oriented, such as those of the inner ear, vision and muscles and joints. Tai chi and yoga are great forms of balance exercises that can help you avoid falls and stay independent well into your senior years. "
How much exercise do I need?,"How much exercise you should be getting depends on several factors, including your current level of fitness, your fitness goals, the types of exercise you’re planning to do, and whether you have deficits in such areas as strength, flexibility or balance. As a general rule, 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise) is recommended as a weekly minimum. As you become more fit, you’ll want to exceed that in order to reap maximum benefit. A natural way of splitting up the 150 minutes might be to do a 30-minute session five times per week, or you can break it up and do two 15-minute sessions during a single day. Adopt whatever schedule fits your lifestyle. For strength exercises, aim to work all your major muscle groups twice to three times each week, leaving 48 hours between each workout for recovery. If you do “total-body” workouts, that’s two sessions per week. If you choose to split your workouts to target a specific muscle group (e.g., “leg day”), that will require more frequent workouts. Just make sure you’re leaving 48 hours of rest before you re-work a major muscle. If you have noticed problems with your balance, such as unsteadiness, dizziness, or vertigo, talk to a healthcare provider for recommendations about balance-specific exercises. Get in three half-hour workouts each week in addition to a 30-minute walk at least twice weekly. It’s best to stretch after you have warmed up for a few minutes, or perform  stretching exercises after you completed your workout. When stretching each muscle group, take it slow and steady, release, repeat again. But how much exercise is too much? You should expect a little muscle soreness after workouts, especially in the beginning. But if you find that your body is simply not recovering between workouts, you may be overtraining. Remember that seniors need more recovery time than younger people. With the exception of “welcome” muscle soreness, an exercise program should make you feel good. If it doesn’t, you’re probably overdoing it. That doesn’t mean you should quit, only that you should dial back the intensity or frequency of your workouts until you hit the “sweet spot” in which you’ve “tired out” your body but then recovered enough to tackle your next session with enthusiasm."
What are the benefits of exercise?,"A smartly designed exercise program will benefit your body and mind in innumerable ways. The benefits of exercise on mental health are well documented. For example, one major study found that sedentary people are 44% more likely to be depressed. Another found that those with mild to moderate depression could get similar results to those obtained through antidepressants just by exercising for 90 minutes each week. The key appears to be the release of brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine, which help lift mood and combat stress. We’re all familiar with exercise’s ability to improve cardiovascular health. But how does exercise lower blood pressure? Interestingly, when you stimulate your circulatory system through aerobic exercise, you’re temporarily increasing your blood pressure by forcing the system to work harder—but when you’ve finished exercising, your blood pressure drops to a lower level than it was before you began. Many people think of exercise as an integral part of weight loss—and, although diet is also extremely important, they’re not wrong. But what exercise burns the most calories? Generally, aerobic exercises (cardio) are great for expending calories and reducing fat. But don’t overlook the effectiveness of strength training, which optimizes your body’s ratio of lean muscle to fat (It’s also the best exercise for bone strength). There’s no Holy Grail when it comes to a single best weight-loss exercise. The best exercise to lose weight is the one you’ll do consistently. Whatever gets your heart rate up and gets your body moving—while having fun and staying motivated—is the exercise that will help you shed pounds."
What if my exercise ability is limited?,"Everyone can and should do some form of exercise, even if they face severe limitations. Experts have designed specific exercises for seniors that are low-impact, safe and able to be done even from a sitting position if necessary. If you’re concerned about fall risk, balance exercises for seniors can be done holding onto a chair or doorframe. For example, standing behind a chair, you can hold its back and lift one leg to about the height of the middle of the calf of the other leg while tightening your abdominal muscles. As you progress, you might try holding the chair with just one hand and eventually letting go of the chair. Evencore-strengthening exercisesfor seniors can be adapted to those with limited abilities. For example, a standard plank is done by holding yourself parallel to the floor with only your forearms and toes touching the mat. An easier version allows you to also place your knees on the mat. But a still easier method is to do the plank while standing and leaning forward. You put your elbows and forearms on a desk, table or wall while resting on the balls of your feet and keeping your back straight. There are a variety of stretching exercises for seniors to suit people of different abilities. Ifholding poses on your handsand knees is out of the question, you could try a full-body stretch in which you lie on your back, straighten your legs and extend your hands along the floor past your head. Some stretches can be done while seated, such as overhead stretches and neck rotations. In fact, other types of exercise also can be done from a seated position. Other chair exercises for seniors include bicep curls (with dumbbells or elastic bands), overhead dumbbell presses, shoulder blade squeezes, calf raises, sit-to-stands (chair squats) and knee extensions. "
What exercises are best for heart health?,"The best exercise program will incorporate both aerobic and strength training, since that’s the best way to strengthen your entire body, improve your endurance and ensure your long-term health. But if your main concern is how to improvecardiovascular health, then you should put a premium on cardiovascular exercises that force your heart and lungs to work harder, sending oxygen to your cells. While strength training certainly does have cardiovascular benefits, cardio workouts excel when it comes to reducing blood pressure, maintaining the health of the inner walls of your arteries, releasing enzymes that break down blood clots, and even promoting the growth of new arteries feeding the heart. Regular aerobic exercise also significantly lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although diabetes usually isn’t thought of as a heart problem, a lower risk of diabetes also lowers the risk of heart disease, since high blood sugar takes a toll on blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart. When you exercise, you call on your body’s cells to take glucose (sugar) out of the blood, which they do by becoming more sensitive to insulin, the hormone crucial to glucose metabolism. That means your cells remain insulin-sensitive long after you’re finished exercising. And since obesity is a significant risk for diabetes, exercises that help you shed fat—especially around your middle—will help you keep diabetes at bay. "
Squats,"Squats activate all major leg muscles at once: the quads and hamstrings (thighs), gluteals (buttocks), and gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris (calves). ""Squats can help you build and maintain a stronger lower body, which makes overall movement easier and safer and allows you to stay active and avoid injuries,"" says Daryanani. Why you hate them.Since most men suffer from tight hip flexors and hamstrings, squatting low can be difficult, and if done incorrectly, squats can cause back pain. Learn to love them.Daryanani points out that you essentially perform a squat any time you sit and stand. ""Therefore, you can get many of the same benefits from regular squats by performing sit-to-stand exercises,"" he says. ""They provide support and are easy to perform, so you can avoid awkward movements that may put stress on your back."" Here's how to do it: Sit in a chair with your feet hip-width apart and place your hands on your thighs. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Exhale as you slowly stand. Then slowly sit in a controlled movement. Take three to five seconds to stand and sit, making sure not to use momentum. To make it easier, use a chair with arms and put your hands on the chair's arms as you stand. For a challenge, do the exercise with your arms crossed in front of your chest, hold a dumbbell or heavy book with both hands at chest level, or hold a dumbbell in each hand. Using a lower chair also can increase the difficulty."
Push-ups,"The old-school push-up is a multipurpose exercise that engages your body from top to bottom by using the arms, chest, core, hips, and legs. Why you hate them.Push-ups often are used as a measure of strength and vitality. ""If you can't do many, or if you struggle, you may see this as a sign of weakness, so you avoid even trying,"" says Daryanani. Also, push-ups were long viewed in the military and gym classes as punishment, so the exercise has an aura of negativity. Learn to love them.""Push-ups easily can be modified in many ways so anyone can successfully do them with confidence,"" says Daryanani. For instance, begin with push-ups done at an angle against a wall or kitchen counter. ""By positioning yourself closer or farther away from the wall or counter and changing the angle, you can increase or decrease the difficulty,"" says Daryanani. ""This way, you can focus on engaging the muscles and can perform with better form."" When you are ready to move to the floor, begin with knee push-ups. Eventually, you can work up to regular push-ups. And never worry how many you can do at one time. ""Proper execution and form, where you can feel your muscles fully engaged, is what's important,"" says Daryanani. ""It's always better to do five good push-ups than 10 bad ones."""
Bridges,"Another great all-in-one move, the bridge works the buttocks, back, and core — where some of your most powerful muscles are. ""You engage these muscles whenever you roll over, get off the floor, or lift heavy objects,"" says Daryanani. To perform a bridge, lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart and parallel to each other. Place your arms at your sides, palms down. Relax your shoulders against the floor. Tighten your buttocks, then lift your hips up off the floor as high as is comfortable. Hold for five seconds, then return to the starting position. Why you hate them.Bridges can feel awkward at first, especially if you have tight or weak core or back muscles. ""Plus, they are not something individuals are accustomed to doing regularly outside of a yoga class,"" says Daryanani. Learn to love them.If you can't lift your hips very high or if arching your back is too difficult, place bolsters or pillows under your back for support. ""This way, you can hold the pose longer and reduce the risk of straining your back,"" says Daryanani. Another option is to lift your hips just high enough to engage your muscles, which may be only a few inches. Image: © Oleg Breslavtsev/Getty Images"
What is HIIT?,"High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a workout style that alternates between intervals of intense effort and recovery. The goal of HIIT is to push your body hard during the high-intensity intervals and allow it to recover during intervals of low- to moderate-intensity activity. During the intense bursts of exercise in a HIIT session, your heart rate rises. A simple way to judge if you are exercising at high intensity is to use the talk test. If you can sing while exercising, you're at low intensity. If you can have a conversation while exercising, your effort is moderate. When you can't say more than a few words without having to take a breath, you're working at high intensity. During recovery periods, your heart rate dips from that peak, but still stays elevated relative to your baseline. This sustained increase means a HIIT workout burns more calories and improves cardiovascular fitness more efficiently than sustained moderate-intensity exercise. The structure of HIIT makes it highly efficient, helping you gain maximum benefits in minimal time. A HIIT workout consists of four essential parts: One of the most appealing features ofhigh-intensity interval trainingis its flexibility. Cardio, strength, or combination workouts can be turned into interval sessions by increasing incline, speed, or resistance to create high-intensity intervals and alternating those with recovery intervals."
Key benefits of HIIT: Boosting cardiovascular health and strength,HIIT workouts offers significant health benefits. Below are some key benefits of incorporating HIIT into your routine:
Modifications and precautions: Adapting HIIT to your abilities,"Remember that intensity depends on your fitness level — what feels intense for you might feel different to someone else. Avoid trying to keep up with younger or more experienced athletes. Instead, focus on gradually increasing your own challenge. Even small bursts of effort can boost your fitness. If you're older, or haven't exercised in a while, modify high-intensity interval training as needed to suit your current fitness level. For example, you may not need to jog as fast or use as much resistance to raise your heart rate as the person next to you at the gym. Consult your doctor before starting a HIIT program, especially if you have any health conditions. If you have heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, be extra cautious and consult a medical professional before incorporating high-intensity efforts into your routine. Call 911 right away if you experience upper body discomfort including chest pain, shortness of breath, or faintness during or after exercising. In terms of frequency, you don't have to do HIIT workouts every day, nor should you. In fact, HIIT is only recommended two to three times a week."
Getting started with HIIT,"Getting started with HIIT as an older adult doesn't have to be intimidating. You can get all the benefits of HIIT just by tweaking whatever exercise you do today. The key is to begin with manageable intervals and gradually increase the intensity as your fitness improves. For example, if you're used to walking for 30 minutes, try walking at your normal pace for five minutes, then walk as fast as you can or jog for one minute. Afterward, return to your usual pace for three minutes. Repeat this cycle several times. If your preferred exercise isswimming, you might try to alternate one leisurely lap with one or two laps swimming at a challenging pace. Work your way up to repeating this pattern for 30 minutes. As you get stronger, you can increase the time and intensity of the higher-intensity intervals while reducing the recovery periods. Always listen to your body and progress at a pace that feels comfortable. Some soreness after a workout is normal, but let your doctor know if you experience persistent or intense muscle pain that starts during a workout or right afterward, or if your muscle soreness lasts for more than one to two weeks."
What are calisthenics?,"Calisthenics is a form of strength training that uses your body weight as a form of resistance to perform full-body exercises. Fitness experts regard calisthenics as an effective way to keep in shape that can help improve strength, endurance, flexibility, and coordination. Push-ups, sit-ups, and jumping jacks are all calisthenics exercises that you may have been doing since gym class as a kid. Today, popular calisthenics exercises like squats, chin-ups, burpees, and planks have been added to the mix. Calisthenics exercises can range from easy to hard and can be modified as needed to meet your fitness level."
Benefits of calisthenics,"Calisthenics has been practiced since the time of the ancient Greeks. This type of exercise offers multiple benefits. Here are a few: Convenience: Calisthenics became one of the most popular exercises during the COVID-19 pandemic. The exercises can be done anywhere and anytime. You can do these exercises when it's convenient for you, where it's convenient for you, and without any special equipment. Plus, it's free. Adaptability: Body-weight exercises can be tailored to fit your fitness level, whether you're just starting out or are already an athlete. As you get stronger, you'll be able to complete more repetitions of the exercise, or incorporate modifications such as pulses or isometric holds to challenge the muscles. Efficiency: Even smaller amounts of body-weight exercise can yield positive results. In one study, a routine of eight simple lower-body exercises — such as squats, knee lifts, and heel raises — led to a 15% increase in muscle strength and power after 10 months. Effectiveness: Body-weight training is highly effective, which is why both the military and elite gymnasts use it to achieve results. Research shows that body-weight exercises can build muscle effectively without the need for external weights. Studies also show calisthenics can increase aerobic capacity, muscle endurance (especially in the core), and flexibility."
Getting started with calisthenics,"Getting started with calisthenics is straightforward since you don't need equipment or a gym. All you need is some space where you can safely do the exercises. This can be in your own home if you have a flat surface with enough space to perform the exercises. Having a repertoire of go-to exercises that are easy to do can also make starting a calisthenics program easier. You can modify these exercises to become more challenging as you develop greater strength and stamina. Before starting any new exercise program, discuss your goals and plans with your doctor, especially if you have a medical condition such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or osteoporosis. To get the best results from your calisthenics program, keep these tips in mind:"
Sample calisthenics workout,"You can try the exercises below as part of a calisthenics routine. When you are training for strength, aim for eight to 12 repetitions, or reps. If you cannot do all the reps at first, just do what you can, and then gradually increase reps as you improve. Beginners can start with one set of reps, working up to three sets as you develop strength. Rest 30 to 90 seconds between sets.  Starting position:Stand up straight with your feet together. Movement:Lift your right knee as high as is comfortable, touching both hands to the knee. Lower your leg, and then repeat with your left knee. This is one rep.  Starting position:Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms at your sides. Movement:Slowly bend your hips and knees, lowering your buttocks about eight inches, as if you're sitting back in a chair. Let your arms swing forward to help you balance. Keep your spine neutral. Hold. Slowly return to the starting position.  Starting position:Kneel on all fours with your hands shoulder-width apart. Walk your hands forward and lower your hips so your body is at a 45° angle to the floor and forms a straight line from head to knees. Movement:Bend your elbows out to the sides and slowly lower your upper body toward the floor until your elbows are bent about 90°. Press against the floor and straighten your arms to return to the starting position. Make it harder:Lift your knees off the floor and do push-ups supporting yourself on your hands and the toes and balls of your feet.  Starting position:Stand up straight with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Movement:Step out to the side with your left foot while keeping your right foot in place. As your left foot hits the ground, transfer most of your weight to your left leg, hinge forward at your hips, and bend your left knee, lowering into a lunge. Keep your right leg straight and put your hands on your left thigh for support. Press into your left foot to stand back up, shifting your weight onto your right foot, and raise your left knee to hip level. Get your balance, and then step out with your left leg again for another lunge. Continue for 30 seconds. Repeat the sequence, stepping out to the right for 30 seconds.  Starting position:Kneel on all fours with your hands and knees directly aligned under your shoulders and hips. Extend both legs with your feet flexed and toes touching the floor so that you are balancing on your palms, toes, and balls of your feet, like the top position of a push-up. This is the plank. Movement:Tighten your abdominal muscles. Lower both knees toward the floor, then extend your legs again to return to the plank position."
Give them a healthy diet,"By healthy I mean a diet with lots of fruits and vegetables (five servings a day are recommended, and they should take up half of every meal plate), whole grains, and lean protein. A healthy diet also has dairy or another source of calcium, and healthy fats like vegetable oils. The foods to avoid are processed foods, foods with added sugar, and foods with unhealthy fats, like the saturated fats found in animal products. That doesn't mean your child can't ever eat cookies or ice cream. But if you want to your child to be healthy, they shouldn't eat those foods every day. (The Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticshas suggestions forhealthier baked goodsand other ways to make your family's diet healthier). There are many supplements that claim to boost your immune system. While the jury is still out as to whether most of them make a real difference, none of them take the place of a healthy diet. If you have a child who refuses vegetables or otherwise has a limited diet, a multivitamin with iron may make sense; talk to your doctor about whether vitamins or supplements are a good idea for your child."
Make sure they get enough sleep,"We all need sleep to refresh and recharge our bodies, and that includes children. The amount of sleep a child needsvaries by age(from 12 to 16 hours a day for infants to eight to 10 hours for teens), and also from child to child (some just need more than others). You can encourage healthy sleep by limiting screens — for teens, devices really should be shut off an hour or two before bedtime, and preferably not be in the bedroom at night — and keeping to a regular schedule."
Get them active,"Exercise keeps us healthy and less likely to get sick. Children should really be active for an hour a day. ""Active"" doesn't have to mean playing a sport or going to the gym; it could be playing at the playground or going for a walk. More is not necessarily better; if you have a child who is a serious athlete, exercising several hours a day, make sure that the exercise isn't eating into sleep or causing burnout, both of which could cause problems with the immune system."
Manage stress,"Stress makes us less healthy and more prone to infection. Make sure that kids have downtime to play, and access to activities and people that make them happy. Spend time together as a family, and create opportunities for your children to talk about anything that might be worrying them. If you have concerns about your child's moods or emotional health, talk to your doctor."
Make sure they are up to date on important vaccines,Immunizations protect us from all sorts of illnesses. Check with your doctor to see if your child is up to date on immunizations. The flu shot is recommended yearly for all people 6 months of age or older.
Don't forget the simple precautions,"Everyone in the family can take simple precautions to help stay healthy. Wash your hands. Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow. Stay away from sick people to the extent that you can. Masks can help, too, especially in crowded indoor spaces. If your child has a health problem that could make it harder to fight off an infection, talk to your doctor about any extra or different precautions you should take."
Finding the time,"Since you need only a minute for a balance exercise, Dunlea recommends integrating it into a free moment that's already built into your day. ""For many people, it's when they're standing and waiting for coffee to brew or brushing their teeth. Or it might be during TV time: think of commercials as your cue to get up and do a balance exercise,"" she suggests. Those opportunities also come with equipment to keep you safe if you become unstable during a balance exercise, such as a counter or desk to hold on to or a chair to fall back on."
Balance exercise ideas,"A counter or sturdy chair works well for several effective balance exercises. For example, a sturdy chair is a good spot for a sit-to-stand exercise — going from a sitting to a standing position, arms crossed, then returning to a sitting position and repeating the process. Dunlea recommends doing this exercise five to 10 times in a row. ""It strengthens your leg and abdominal muscles and trains you to shift the main weight of your body up over your feet — your base of support,"" she explains. A counter works well for doing one minute of heel raises, tandem standing or walking, or standing on one leg (see ""3 balance exercises to try at home""). ""Standing on one leg is especially helpful for tasks requiring you to shift your weight and balance on one leg for a moment, such as climbing stairs or stepping up onto a curb,"" Dunlea says. But don't continue a balance exercise if it's so challenging that you're at risk of falling. And if you currently have balance problems, it's best to work with a physical therapist before trying these moves on your own. For more information, check out the Harvard Special Health ReportBetter Balance."
3 balance exercises to try at home," Stand with your arms at your sides. Place your left foot directly in front of your right foot, heel to toe, and squeeze your inner thighs together. Lift your arms out to your sides to help you balance. Hold the position up to 30 seconds. Return to the starting position, then repeat with your right foot in front.  Stand with your arms at your sides. Lift your heels, shifting your weight to the balls of your feet. Try to balance evenly without allowing your ankles to roll inward or outward. Hold. Lower your heels to the floor, maintaining good posture as you do. Repeat 10 times.  Stand with your arms at your sides. Bend your right knee, lifting that foot several inches off the floor, and balance on your left leg. Hold the position up to 30 seconds. Return to the starting position, then repeat the process while balancing on your right leg. Exercise photos by Michael Carroll"
On call," Q.I have heard that you should not exercise at night because it can cause sleep problems. Is this true? A.Traditionally, experts have recommended not exercising at night as part of good sleep hygiene. However, a small study, published inSports Medicinesuggests that some people can exercise in the evening as long as they avoid vigorous activity for at least one hour before bedtime. The researchers examined 23 studies that evaluated sleep onset and quality in healthy adults who performed a single session of evening exercise compared with similar adults who did not. They found that not only did evening exercise not affect sleep, it seemed to help people fall asleep faster and spend more time in deep sleep. However, those who did high-intensity exercise — such as interval training — less than one hour before bedtime took longer to fall asleep and had poorer sleep quality. Despite the findings in this particular study, I generally recommend against strenuous physical activity for at least two hours before getting into bed. In addition to regular exercise, you can help achieving quality sleep by doing the following: — by Howard LeWine, M.D.Editor in Chief,Harvard Men's Health Watch Image: © Wavebreakmedia/Getty Images"
What’s the best diet for weight loss?,"It’s a question on the minds of most people once they’ve decided they need to shed some pounds—what is the best diet for weight loss?While that’s not an unreasonable question, it often implies an approach that is less than optimal, which is to plan on adopting a radically restrictive mode of eating for a while, until the weight is lost, and then going back to eating as normal. Instead of embracing “fad diets,” people who have lost weight—and kept it off—usually have made a permanent shift toward healthier eating habits. Simply replacing unhealthy foods with healthy ones—not for a few weeks, but forever—will help you achieve weight loss while also offering numerous other benefits. So a better set of questions might be, “What is a healthy diet? What does a healthy diet look like?” A healthy diet favors natural, unprocessed foods over pre-packaged meals and snacks. It is balanced, meaning that it provides your body with all the nutrients and minerals it needs to function best. It emphasizes plant-based foods—especially fruits and vegetables—over animal foods. It contains plenty of protein. It is low in sugar and salt. It incorporates “healthy fats” including fish, olive oil and other plant-derived oils. Here a few examples of healthy meals for weight loss. For breakfast, a bowl of bran flakes with sliced strawberries and walnuts with nonfat milk. For lunch, a turkey sandwich on wheat with vegetables and an olive oil and vinegar dressing. For dinner, a salmon steak on a bed of spinach. You don’t have to cut out snacks in order to eat a healthy diet, either. Healthy snacks for weight loss include almonds or pistachios, string cheese with an apple, Greek yogurt or a banana with peanut butter. Before you begin your weight-loss journey, do some brainstorming about the kinds of healthy foods you enjoy so that you can have lots of choices as you plan your meals and snacks. Remember that the best diet is the one you’ll stick to, so don’t rush out and buy a bunch of “health foods” that you know you’ll never eat. "
What's the healthiest diet?,"There is no single diet that nutritionists have deemed “the healthiest.” However, there are several styles of eating that experts either have designed for optimal health or have observed to be healthy when consumed traditionally by different people around the world. Such styles of eating tend to have a few things in common—they tend to be plant-based diets, they emphasize healthy fats, no simple sugars and low sodium, and they favor natural foods over the highly processed fare typical of much of the Western diet. For example,the Mediterranean style dietgets its name from the foods available to various cultures located around the Mediterranean Sea. It heavily emphasizes minimally processed fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains. It contains moderate amounts of yogurt, cheese, poultry and fish. Olive oil is its primary cooking fat. Red meat and foods with added sugars are only eaten sparingly. Besides being an effective weight loss method, eating a Mediterranean style diet is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, depression and some forms of cancer. Experts developedthe DASH diet(Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) specifically as a heart-healthy regimen. The combination of food types contained in the diet seem to work together especially effectively to lower blood pressure and decrease risk of heart failure. The key features of DASH are low cholesterol and saturated fats, lots of magnesium, calcium, fiber and potassium, and little to no red meat and sugar. Unsurprisingly, that equates to a list of foods similar to those of the Mediterranean diet—whole grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry, nuts and olive oil. As its name implies, the MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) was designed by doctors to take elements from the Mediterranean and DASH diets that seemed to provide benefits to brain health and stave off dementia and cognitive decline. In practice, it is very similar to both the Mediterranean and DASH diets, but it puts stronger emphasis on leafy green vegetables and berries, and less emphasis on fruit and dairy. In recent years, the Nordic diet has emerged as both a weight-loss and health-maintenance diet. Based on Scandinavian eating patterns, the Nordic diet is heavy on fish, apples, pears, whole grains such as rye and oats, and cold-climate vegetables including cabbage, carrots and cauliflower. Studies have supported its use both in preventing stroke and in weight loss. What do all of these diets have in common? They’re all good for your heart, they all consist of natural unprocessed foods and they all contain plenty of plant-based dishes. Eating for your health—especially your heart health—by adopting elements from these diets is a smart way to lose weight.  "
What is intermittent fasting?,"You’ve probably heard some inspiring success stories aboutintermittent fasting. But is fasting healthy, and does intermittent fasting work? Fasting—abstaining from eating for some period of time—is an ancient practice that is safe when not taken to extremes. Traditionally, the benefits of fasting have been both spiritual and physical. People who fast for religious reasons often report a stronger focus on spiritual matters during the fast. Physically, a simple fast lowers blood sugar, reduces inflammation, improves metabolism, clears out toxins from damaged cells and has been linked to lower risk of cancer, reduced pain from arthritis and enhanced brain function. Intermittent fasting means dividing one’s time between “eating windows” and periods of abstention on a regular basis. A common intermittent fasting schedule might restrict eating to the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., with the remaining 16 hours of the day spent fasting. But there is no specific, prescribed schedule. Some people have more or less generous eating windows, setting the rule that they will not eat after, say, 8:00 p.m.—or, on the considerably less generous side, only allowing themselves to eat every other day. The science behind intermittent fasting is based on altering the body’s metabolism. During a period without eating, insulin levels drop to the point that the body begins burning fat for fuel. Additionally, the thinking goes, by slowing the body’s metabolism, you cause your appetite to drop off and thus will consume fewer calories when you resume eating. Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits of intermittent fasting for weight loss. However, it’s not clear that it is any more effective than simply restricting calories and following a normal eating schedule. One possible reason for the success of intermittent fasting is that most practitioners have quit the habit of eating during the late evening and night hours. Restricting eating to earlier in the day aligns better with our bodies’ circadian rhythms and is less likely to cause us to store our food in fat cells. Since intermittent fasting is difficult for many people to adhere to, a wise alternative might be to consume a low-calorie Mediterranean diet and to stop the day’s eating in late afternoon. There are certain people who should not try intermittent fasting without first checking with their doctor, such those with diabetes or heart disease. Intermittent fasting is a very “lifestyle-intensive” dietary pattern, meaning that it is challenging to maintain in the face of normal social relationships. If the rest of your family is eating while you’re fasting, you might be tempted to indulge or to surrender the family-meal ritual. If your job requires you to dine with clients or colleagues, you’ll find an intermittent fasting schedule difficult to maintain. Remember that the best healthy eating plan is the one you’ll stick to. "
What’s a high-fat weight loss diet?,"It sounds counterintuitive, but many people find success losing weight—especially initially—by eating more fat, not less. Called a ketogenic orKeto diet, this method requires shifting the main source of calories over to fatty foods—between 75% and 90% of what you eat, with only 10-20% of your calories coming from protein and a mere 5% from carbohydrates. The theory is that by eating so many healthy fats and restricting carbohydrates, you enter an altered metabolic state in which you force your body to begin relying on fat for energy, burning away your fat stores instead of sugar for fuel. Research does show that keto is an effective way to jump-start weight loss and improve blood-sugar levels. However, it is hard to maintain, and to date we are lacking long-term studies that show it to be a sustainable eating pattern for keeping weight off."
What does a Healthy Eating Plate look like?,"Because both weight loss and overall health are tied to some basic eating patterns, we have developedthe Harvard Healthy Eating Plateas a model for meal planning and for your overall balanced diet. Imagine a round dinner plate with a line running vertically down its center dividing it evenly in two. One half of the plate should be taken up by equal portions of whole grains (not refined grains like white bread and white rice) and healthy protein (such as fish, nuts, beans and poultry—not red meat or processed meats). Two-thirds of the other half should be filled with vegetables, with the remaining portion consisting of fruit. Try to inject a lot of variety into this half of your plate (or half of your diet)—eat fruits in a variety of colors and vegetables of all types (but don’t count potatoes or French fries as vegetables). To one side of the plate, picture a glass of water, since that’s the best drink for weight loss and for overall health (At some meals you can substitute coffee or tea with little to no sugar). Don’t drink more than a serving or two of milk each day. To the other side of the plate, imagine a vessel containing healthy oils such as canola or olive oil. Use it for cooking or at the table instead of butter . Remember the Healthy Eating Platewhen you’re contemplating what to eat for a specific meal, when you’re grocery shopping, or when you’re strategizing about how to lose weight and keep it off. Adhering to its guidelines will optimize your chances of remaining healthy and of maintaining a desirable body weight. "
What might cause sudden cardiac arrest or death in children or teens?,There are several heart conditions that can lead to a risk of sudden death. They include
Four important screening questions can help identify cardiac risk,"Many of these conditions can and do go unrecognized for years. However, the AAP says that these four questions can help identify which children may be at risk: The last question underlines the importance of knowing details of your family history. We don't always like to pry, but knowing the details can be crucial for the health of others in the family. So don't be afraid to ask family members about the exact diagnosis they have been given by a doctor — and then share that diagnosis with your doctor. This is true of all health problems, not just heart problems. Of course, some people may not have access to their family health information."
How often should this screening be done?,"Ideally, according to the AAP, your child's doctor should ask these questions at routine checkups at least once every three years, or on entry to middle or junior high school and on entry to high school. If the answer is yes to any of the questions, the child should be referred to a cardiologist (or to a cardiologist that specializes in arrhythmias) for further evaluation. Until they are cleared, they shouldn't participate in sports. Families don't need to wait for a pediatrician to ask the questions, though. If the answer to any of them is yes, or might be yes, talk to your child's doctor right away. You could literally save your child's life."
Your resting heart rate,"When you are at rest, your heart is pumping the lowest amount of blood to supply the oxygen your body's needs. Although the official normal resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, the range for most healthy adults is between 55 and 85 beats per minute. However, other factors can affect your resting heart rate, such as"
What is a good resting heart rate?,"There is no specific good resting heart rate. Well-trained athletes can have numbers in the 40s. But a heart rate that slow for the average person would be concerning and should prompt a call to your doctor's office, especially if you felt weak, lightheaded, or short of breath. On the other end of the scale, a resting heart rate that is consistently above 90 beats per minute is also something your doctor should be aware of. Although it is still formally still normal, it could be a clue of something amiss, but not necessarily a serious problem."
Your maximum heart rate,"The rate at which your heart is beating when it is working its hardest to meet your body's oxygen needs is your maximum heart rate. Your maximum heart rate plays a major role in setting your aerobic capacity — the amount of oxygen you are able to consume. Several large observational studies have indicated that a high aerobic capacity is associated with a lower risk of heart attack and death. And a small, controlled trial demonstrated that men and women with mild cognitive impairment who raised their aerobic capacity also improved their performance on tests of memory and reasoning. Similar to resting heart, your maximum heart rate also depends on multiple factors. As people age, average maximum heart rate falls. A commonly used formula to determine your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age in years. "
How exercise affects heart rate,"Vigorous exercise is the best way to both lower your resting heart rate and increase your maximum heart rate and aerobic capacity. Because it's impossible to maintain a maximum heart rate for more than a few minutes, physiologists have advised setting a percentage of your maximum heart rate as a target during exercise. If you're starting an exercise program, you may want to set your target rate at 50% of maximum, and gradually increase the intensity of your workout until you reach 70% to 80%. However, if you don't exercise regularly, you should check with your doctor before you set a target heart rate. Some medications — particularly beta blockers — can lower your heart rate. Your doctor can help you set realistic goals. Image: Peera_Sathawirawong/Getty Images"
Keep on moving,"It is tempting to avoid the motions that cause you pain. But limiting your movements can weaken muscles and make compound joint trouble worse. And actually movement— in the form of the right exercises performed properly —can be a long-lasting way to subdue ankle, knee, hip, or shoulder pain. For some people, the right exercise routine can even help delay or sidestep surgery. Your goal should be to pair gentle, targeted joint workouts with a simple walking routine. Your doctor should advise you before you begin a new exercise program."
Simple stretching tips,"If you start targeted joint exercises, these simple stretching tips are important to any workout: For more on developing and mastering joint pain relief workout, readThe Joint Pain Relief Workout, a Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School.

"Runners can get arthritis, but is running the cause?","You may think the answer is obvious. Surely, years of running (pounding pavements, or even softer surfaces) could wear out your joints, much like tires wear out after you put enough miles on them. Andosteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, usually affects older adults. In fact, it's often described as age-related and degenerative. That sounds like a wear-and-tear sort of situation, right? Maybe not. Sure, it's easy to blame running when a person who runs regularly develops arthritis. But that blame may be misguided. The questions to ask are: Extensive research over the last several decades has investigated these questions. While the answers are still not entirely clear, we're moving closer."
What is the relationship between running and arthritis?,"Mounting evidence suggests that that running doesnotcause osteoarthritis, or any other joint disease. These are just a few of the published medical studies on the subject. Overall, research suggests that running is an unlikely cause of arthritis — and might even be protective."
The bottom line,"Trends in recent research suggest that running does not wear out your joints. That should be reassuring for those of us who enjoy running. And if you don't like to run, that's fine: try to find forms of exercise that you enjoy more. Just don't base your decision — or excuse — for not running on the idea that it will ruin your joints."
Signs of weakness,"Muscle atrophy can occur from a disease that primarily affects the muscles, such as polymyositis (an autoimmune inflammatory disease). Diseases that rob the muscles of energy, like cancer and malnutrition, are other causes. But muscle loss most often is due to physiologic atrophy, which happens when people don't use their muscles enough for an extended period. Besides an injury or surgery, physiologic atrophy can occur because of osteoarthritis, which makes staying active difficult, or a sedentary lifestyle. Muscle atrophy can lead to Muscle atrophy does not always happen after a physical setback. How a period of downtime affects you depends on your prior health, activity level, and amount of muscle mass. ""Men who are regularly active have a much easier time preventing muscle atrophy even if they are off their feet for a while,"" says Klein. Still, it doesn't take long for the body to lose what it has gained. A  study in theJournal of Rehabilitation Medicinefound that older men who did eight weeks of strength training lost about 25% of their muscle gains after they stopped training for two weeks. ""A sudden stop in activity is like slamming on the brakes and can be quite jarring to the body,"" says Klein. ""Even minor muscle atrophy can cause some loss of strength and movement and make activity more difficult."""
Make a move,"While you can quickly lose muscle because of physiologic atrophy, you also can get it back. It's best to get advice from your doctor. He or she can recommend an appropriate program to rebuild your lost muscle. This often includes physical therapy, strength training, cardio workouts, flexibility exercises, and a nutrition plan that may increase protein and calories. There is also much you can do on your own to increase and maintain muscle mass and strength. Almost any activity that works the upper and lower body can help you regain what you have lost. Weight training is ideal and can include workouts with dumbbells and resistance bands. Other muscle-building exercises include rowing, swimming, walking, and cycling (stationary or regular bike). ""Focus on exercises you can do safely and consistently, or better yet, enlist a trainer to create a specialized plan based on your limitations and needs,"" says Klein. Keep in mind that you have to take small steps at first, and it may take time to get back to where you were. ""But focus on the fact that you are moving,"" says Klein. ""Any activity is always better than no activity."" Image: © Paul Bradbury/Getty Images"
Cardiac rehab,"Many people with heart disease qualify for cardiac rehabilitation. The initial evaluation includes an exercise stress test, a closely monitored workout done on a treadmill or stationary bike that shows how your heart and body respond to exertion. The results can help your rehab team offer safe, effective suggestions for physical activity. Unfortunately, not everyone who qualifies for cardiac rehab has easy access to such a program, which typically requires you to attend a few times a week for several months. However, a hybrid program that includes some online sessions may be available (see ""A virtual approach to healing the heart"" in the October 2022Heart Letter). Another option is to ask your cardiac surgeon, cardiologist, or primary care doctor to prescribe an exercise stress test, which can be reassuring for people who are worried about exercising, says Dr. Skali. If you're generally healthy, your doctor might decide that you don't need a stress test and can go ahead and start exercising on your own."
After a procedure,"After any procedure, wait until your doctor gives you the green light to start exercising. After an angioplasty (a minimally invasive procedure to widen a narrowed or blocked heart artery), you can usually resume your normal activities after two days. If you had the procedure to treat a heart attack, you might need to take it easy for a bit longer. People often need a month or more to fully recover from open heart surgery, which requires sawing through the breastbone. But that doesn't mean avoiding exercise as you heal. In fact, a small study found that starting cardiac rehab just two weeks after surgery was just as effective and likely as safe as waiting for six weeks, says Dr. Skali. The good news is that people often have more energy and endurance after their heart is repaired. Take it easy at first, starting ""low and slow,"" especially if exercise hasn't been part of your regular routine, says Dr. Skali. Walking outside or on a treadmill for just five minutes at a time several times a day is a good way to start. Keep adding a few minutes to your walks every week or so, until you're up to at least 20 minutes a day. Pay attention to how you're feeling, and add intensity by walking briskly (or even jogging) for short bouts if that feels okay."
Rest as needed,"Even people who've never exercised and have several serious health problems can still exercise. ""I have patients with heart failure and obesity who tell me they can't walk for more than one minute,"" Dr. Skali says. His advice: Put a chair at each end of your driveway or whatever short distance you can manage. Walk back and forth between the chairs, sitting down to rest when needed to catch your breath. Try to do four laps in the morning, and then another four laps in the afternoon. ""Even just 30 seconds at a time is enough to make progress,"" he says. And no matter what your fitness level, always stop or slow down if you feel dizzy, weak, or breathless. Image: © luciano/Getty Images"
Breaking it down,"The first step to overcoming these obstacles is to break down the time commitment into manageable segments. For example, 150 minutes is 2.5 hours, which comes to 30 minutes five days a week, or about 20 minutes daily. ""And you don't have to do those 20 to 30 minutes all at once,"" says Dr. Apovian. ""You can further divide into two or three 10-minute daily segments. Everyone has 10 minutes to devote to exercise."" Next, change your perception of ""moderate intensity."" ""People automatically feel overwhelmed because it sounds difficult, but this level of exertion is not as physically demanding as people may think and is quite doable,"" says Dr. Apovian. (See ""How to measure moderate-intensity exercise."")"
Different kinds of aerobics,"Any kind of movement that gets the heart rate up, speeds up your breathing, and makes you sweat a little counts as aerobic exercise. The best exercise is the one you enjoy. But don't assume you are limited to traditional activities like running, cycling, swimming, or tennis. There are other options that may better fit your interests, comfort level, and ability. Here are some examples. Brisk walking.Walking at a brisk pace is a simple moderate-intensity workout. But what is ""brisk""? That pace is different for everyone, but here is advice from President Harry Truman, known for his quick-paced morning walks around Independence, Mo., after he left office. He followed a pace of 120 steps a minute for 1.5 miles, a routine he learned in the Army. ""You swing your arms and take deep breaths as you walk … your whole body gets a vigorous workout,"" he wrote. Stair climbing.Set a timer for five to 10 minutes and go up and down stairs at a casual pace. Treadmill.The trusty treadmill can be an excellent cardio tool, as you can adjust the incline and speed to reach the required intensity. Marching in place.You don't need a lot of space for cardio. For instance, try marching in place. Stand with your feet together and arms at your sides. Bend your elbows and swing your arms as you lift your knees, one at a time, bringing them as high as possible with each movement. March in place for 50 steps at a steady rhythm. Rest and repeat several times. Home work.Many household chores count as moderate-intensity exercises. Examples include mowing the lawn, raking leaves, digging and planting, washing the car, and vacuuming. ""Even though these are often stop-and-go activities and may feel light, the movements can add up,"" says Dr. Apovian. Weight training.Guidelines also recommend doing weight training on at least two days of the week to help build and maintain muscle mass. But this also can be a way to add in some moderate-intensity aerobics. ""Doing weight training exercises in a circuit fashion, where you move from one exercise to the next with little to no rest, can elevate the heart rate enough to provide cardio benefits,"" says Dr. Apovian. Different movements.""Almost any kind of movement can qualify if done with enough effort,"" says Dr. Apovian. ""Take a dance class, go for a hike, play pickleball, or walk 18 holes of golf instead of riding a cart."" Image: © Amir Mukhtar/Getty Images"
What does the warm-up do?,Warm-up activities accomplish several tasks:
For moderate-intensity activity,"The type of warm-up you need depends on your activity. For a strengthening routine or moderate-intensity activity (such as brisk walking or riding a bike on level ground), marching in place for a few minutes makes an effective warm-up. Swing your arms as you march. ""Alternating leg activity can quickly raise the heart rate, which is important in a warm-up,"" Ruggeri says. ""Marching also works your leg and buttock muscles. The leg you lift works the hip flexor. Your stationary leg works the gluteal muscles [in the buttocks] and the quadriceps [in the thighs]."""
For more intense activity,"For vigorous physical activity, such as swimming or playing tennis, or for activity involving strenuous physical movements, such as golf, you'll need a more extensive warm-up. For example: ""Golf requires that you swing your arms and turn your trunk. Tennis and pickleball require those movements, plus lateral shuffles. So you'll want to prepare the muscles for that,"" Ruggeri says. One way to warm up is by practicing moves you'll perform later. ""Do the movement repeatedly, in a slow and controlled manner, to allow the body to adjust to the activity,"" Ruggeri says. ""For example, for tennis, stand in place and slowly perform a backhand swing to warm up the shoulder and core muscles."" Other warm-up activities to perform before vigorous exercise include marching in place, arm sweeps (sweeping your arms overhead), torso rotations (turning your torso left and then right), and the following moves. Step-ups.Facing the lowest step in a staircase, take one full step up and then step back down. Repeat the exercise 10 times, take a break, then do another 10 step-ups. ""This targets your quadriceps muscles when you step up, and your gluteal muscles when you step down. When you step up with one leg at a time, you also activate your core and back muscles to help keep your body upright,"" says Ruggeri. Arm circles.Put your arms out to the sides and move them in circles of varying size (small, medium, and then large). Move them in forward circles for 30 seconds, then backward circles for 30 seconds. ""This helps the shoulder muscles and the rotator cuff, a group of muscles and tendons at the shoulder,"" Ruggeri says. ""The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, and these circles allow for the full range of shoulder movement."" Air punches.Punch the air in front of you, alternating right and left arms, for 30 seconds. Then do 30 seconds of cross-body punches: punch your right hand to the left, and then your left hand to the right. Try some uppercuts, too (punching upward). ""Punches increase your heart rate and get more blood flowing through the arm,"" Ruggeri says."
Stretching after activity,"After the warm-up, do your workout. Finish the activity with stretches — gently holding each stretch for about 30 to 60 seconds. Ruggeri recommends stretching the shoulders, buttocks and hip muscles, upper leg muscles (the hamstrings and quadriceps), and calves. This will keep muscles long and supple, and ready to respond the next time you call on them for a workout or everyday activity."
"Can an exercise routine really help keep your mental ""muscles"" in good shape?","Meditating or tai chi may increase the brain's capacity to switch between different tasks.Image: Michael Carroll Photography/Thinkstock Fear of losing your memory and thinking skills is one of the greatest concerns of getting older. Maybe that's behind the increasing number of clinics offering brain fitness programs. ""Brain training"" isn't a typical exercise program; it incorporates a number of activities and lifestyle changes to help boost brain function. ""People come in with problems accessing words or memories or making decisions, and we do see them improve, although we can't say it's from any one therapy,"" says neurologist Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, director of the Brain Fit Program at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center."
What's involved?,A typical brain fitness program incorporates the following.
Finding a program,"Hospitals and research facilities offer brain fitness programs, and so do private practices. ""Ideally you want people who have done this for a long time and who offer a multidisciplinary approach, with a neurologist, psychologist, social worker, physical therapist, and dietitian,"" says Dr. Pascual-Leone. Beware of promises of cures, and don't assume that doing well on a computer game means you're improving. ""If you do one thing often, you'll get better at that one thing. But you want to get better in everyday activity, not just at the clinic,"" warns Dr. Pascual-Leone. Look for programs that measure the biological effects of the training, and experts who'll explain the results and how the information will help you. "
What is xylitol?,"A naturally occurring sugar alcohol found (in trace amounts) in many fruits and vegetables, xylitol can be processed from certain trees or from a plant fiber called xylan. It tastes about as sweet as regular sugar, but with only about half the calories per serving. Store-bought xylitol is a white, crystalline powder that can be used as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in recipes."
What are the health benefits of xylitol?,"Eating too much sugar has been linked to a host of serious health problems, includingdiabetes, heart disease,obesity, andtooth decay, so sugar-free sweeteners like xylitol are a compelling alternative. Xylitol is an excellent alternative to sugar for people who need to watch their weight, their blood sugar levels, or both. The sugar alcohol contains about 2.4 calories per gram (compared with 4 calories per gram in regular sugar). That makes it a good option for those who want to limit their simple carbohydrate intake, like people with diabetes or related metabolic syndromes. When measured on theglycemic index(GI), a measure of how quickly food raises blood sugar, xylitol's GI score is 7, while regular sugar has a GI score of about 60. Xylitol's lower GI score correlates to more sustained energy without the spike and plunge associated with a sudden intake of regular sugar. Xylitol may help prevent tooth decay by reducing levels of bad bacteria in your mouth. According to areviewpublished in theJournal of International Society of Preventive & Community Dentistry,consuming 5 to 10 grams per day of xylitol-containing products (like lozenges, candies, chewing gum, toothpaste, or mouth rinse) significantly prevented cavities and tooth decay compared with products that do not contain xylitol. So don't be surprised if your dentist recommends a xylitol-containing chewing gum at your next checkup."
Xylitol in everyday products,"Many sugar-free products contain xylitol, including sugar-free candy, gum, baked goods, mints, cough syrup, chewable vitamins, some nut butters, ice cream, and oral hygiene products like toothpaste and mouthwash. You can also buy xylitol in bulk at most grocery stores or online retailers to use in cooking and baking."
Possible side effects,"Most people can add xylitol to their diets without noticing any side effects. But some people may experience digestive problems like gas, bloating, and diarrhea if they consume too much too quickly. If you notice uncomfortable digestive problems, cut back your xylitol intake and reintroduce it slowly. And if you have other digestive issues, such asirritable bowel syndrome(IBS), you may want to avoid sugar alcohols entirely. Additionally,an observational studypublished in the June issue ofEuropean Heart Journalfound that high levels of xylitol were associated with greater risk of heart attack or stroke in adults years later. While more research is needed (the study was small, and observational versus experimental), it's best to keep your consumption of xylitol in check."
Keep xylitol away from your dog,"Xylitol is highly toxic to dogs, causing dangerously low blood sugar, liver failure, and even death. Keep sugar-free products out of your dog's reach, and always check the ingredient label on ice cream and peanut butter before offering it to your pup."
What did the study look at?,"Published July 2024 inAnnals of Internal Medicine, the newstudydrew on data from more than 183,000 people between ages 20 and 80. Their average age was 48, and 65% were women. Most were overweight or obese at the study's start. The researchers analyzed participants' electronic health records and body mass index. They gauged weight gain or loss at regular intervals — six, 12, and 24 months — after people began taking an antidepressant for the first time. The study compared the weight-related effects of sertraline (Zoloft) to seven other antidepressant medications:"
What did the research find?,"The antidepressants led to the following average weight gain: Citalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine didn't confer lower or higher odds of weight gain than Zoloft, the study found. And only bupropion was associated with a small amount of weight loss — 0.25-pounds — at six months. But that trend reversed at 24 months, when bupropion led to an average weight gain of 1.2 pounds."
What does the study tell us?,"""Weight gain is common among antidepressant users, even if the amounts gained on average are modest,"" says Dr. Perlis, who was not involved in this new study. It underscores similar findings from other studies of antidepressants, includingresearchhe published with colleagues a decade ago. ""While differences in weight gain for specific antidepressants tend to be small, there are certainly some — like bupropion — that tend to cause less weight gain,"" he notes. It's crucial to keep in mind that the study points out average weight gain. Many people taking antidepressants won't gain any weight and others could gain more. ""Still, having average values to work with — and seeing that these averages line up well with prior studies — at least lets us give people a sense of what they might expect,"" he says. ""One caution is that some people lose weight as a result of depression, which can impact appetite,"" he adds, ""so some of what we're seeing may be people regaining weight they'd lost as their depression or anxiety improves."""
What additional limitations did the study have?,"Other limitations may have shaped the findings. The study was observational, meaning it cannot prove that antidepressants cause weight changes, only that they were linked with them. It wasn't a randomized, controlled trial — considered the gold standard in research — and the participants taking antidepressants weren't compared to a control group not taking the medications. Additionally, only about one in three participants was still taking their initially prescribed medication six months after the study started. That makes it difficult to link any later weight changes with a specific medication. ""As with any study that's not randomized, we don't know if the differences between medicines could reflect other differences in who gets prescribed these medicines,"" Dr. Perlis says. ""But, for circumstances where a randomized trial is unrealistic, health records can be a helpful way of trying to study side effects and at least generate a partial answer to these important questions."""
What else should you consider?,"Another thing to consider, if you're taking an antidepressant, is what types of side effects you're willing to tolerate in pursuit of its mood-smoothing benefits. ""The best way to manage side effects is to anticipate them — to have an open conversation with your doctor about the potential risks and how we'll manage them if they occur,"" Dr. Perlis says."
What can you discuss with your doctor?,"If weight gain is a particular concern for you, you may also wish to consider nondrug treatments for depression. They include: ""We know that certain kinds of talk therapies, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, can be very effective for treating depression and anxiety disorders,"" Dr. Perlis says. ""Whether people choose talk therapy or antidepressant medications can depend on their preference. It's important to have multiple options."""
Night owl risks,"A growing amount of evidence suggests that being a night owl may increase the risk of developing many health problems. For example, a 2023 Harvard-led study of about 64,000 healthy middle-aged women, followed for eight years, found that those who said they were night owls were 72% more likely to develop diabetes than morning larks. The night owls were also more likely than morning larks to be overweight and have an unhealthy life-style — drinking a lot of alcohol, smoking, eating a poor diet, and getting too little sleep. Even after scientists calculated the impact of those lifestyle factors on health, the night owls were still 19% more likely to develop diabetes than morning larks. In addition, a 2021 study of almost 137,000 middle-aged and older adults suggested that having a bedtime past 10 p.m. was tied to a 20% greater risk of having obesity or a dangerously large waistline (35 or more inches for women, 40 or more for men), compared with people who went to bed between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The risk for obesity was even higher (35% to 38%) among people who went to bed between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Night owls in this study also slept fewer hours (six or seven hours per night) than morning larks (eight or nine hours per night)."
The risks of little sleep,"The fact that night owls sometimes sleep less than morning larks only adds to the risk. Sleep is the time when the brain flushes out toxins and consolidates memories and new bits of information. It's when our muscles and cells rebuild. Getting an inadequate amount of good-quality sleep is linked to poor concentration; increased risks of falls, broken bones, and car crashes; a weakened immune system; and many diseases, such as dementia, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, and depression."
The power of darkness,"The typical human sleep-wake cycle makes the desire for sleep strongest between midnight and dawn, when it's dark outside. ""We sleep best, with the highest-quality sleep, when the sun is down. That's just how we're wired,"" says Dr. Kenneth Sassower, a pediatric and adult sleep neurologist at Harvard-­affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""If you're a night owl and you don't go to sleep until the middle of the night, you're not maximizing the number of hours you can sleep in darkness. The sun comes up soon after your bedtime, which might lead to poor-quality or interrupted sleep."""
Changing your sleep schedule,"It's not that the evidence is so strong that night owls should definitely go to sleep and awaken earlier. But the evidence is convincing enough that it's worth a try, particularly if you're not sleeping long enough or if the bulk of your sleep isn't occurring when it's dark outside. Is it possible to shift your sleep-wake cycle, even if you're not wired to go to bed earlier? ""Yes, but it's a slow process,"" Dr. Sassower says. He recommends the following steps. Set a bedtime goal.Dr. Sassower suggests aiming for a bedtime between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., so you'll get at least five hours of sleep in darkness. Gradually go to bed earlier.""You can't just start going to sleep hours earlier and expect to make a lasting change to your sleep-wake cycle. Your brain won't comply,"" Dr. Sassower says. He advises rolling back your bedtime by 20 minutes every five days, until you reach your desired bedtime. For example, if you currently go to sleep at 1 a.m. each night and would prefer a bedtime of about 11:30 p.m., go to sleep at 12:40 a.m. for five nights then 12:20 a.m. for five nights then midnight for five nights then 11:40 p.m. for five nights then 11:20 p.m. indefinitely. Use medication.Until you reach your bedtime goal, it might help to take melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle. If you use an over-the-counter supplement, you should take it two hours before bedtime. It would be more effective, Dr. Sassower says, if you take a more potent prescription version of melatonin, a drug called ramelteon (Rozerem), at bedtime. You'll have to talk to your doctor about that. Set a wake time.""Don't get up late,"" Dr. Sassower says. ""You need a consistent wake time to train the brain. Don't make it any later than 9 a.m."" Be patient.Once you've reached your bedtime goal, it will take about 90 days to officially establish the new sleep schedule and make it stick. ""I'm not saying it's easy,"" Dr. Sassower says, ""but it can be done. And you'll probably sleep better, feel the difference, and improve your health."" Image: © Aleutie/Getty Images"
Rev up your engine,"Is it possible to speed up a naturally slow metabolism, or rev up one that has become sluggish over time? You can manipulate your metabolism to a degree. It is often a small change that may help you burn more calories. That, along with adopting a healthier diet and making sure you get enough exercise, may give people the extra push they need to lose and maintain weight. For example: Pick up the pace.Add some high-intensity interval training to your regular routine. After a period of interval training, your metabolism can stay revved up for as much as a full day. For example, when you're walking or jogging on a treadmill or outside, speed up for 30 to 60 seconds, and then slow to your usual pace; repeat the cycle for eight to 12 minutes. Eat protein and do weight training.Your metabolism increases whenever you eat, digest, and store food, a process called thermic effect of food. Protein has a higher thermic effect compared with fats and carbohydrates because it takes longer for your body to burn protein and absorb it. It's not clear how much of an effect protein has on metabolism, but studies suggest the best approach is to combine adequate protein intake with weight training, which increases muscle mass — and that also can boost metabolism. Use this online calculator to determine your exact daily amount of protein:/dri. Drink green tea.Studies have found green tea contains a compound called epigallocatechin gallate, which may increase the calories and fat you burn. A meta-analysis published inObesity Reviewsfound that consuming about 250 milligrams of epigallocatechin gallate (the amount in about three cups of green tea) helped boost metabolism enough to burn an average of 100 extra calories a day.

What are the risks of a carnivore diet?,"While some keto diets can emphasize the intake of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, that's not the case with carnivore diets. Animal fat is mostly saturated fat, which is the unhealthiest type of fat because it raises levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol. The disadvantage of all keto diets is they tend to raise LDL cholesterol levels in both the short and long term. Other longer-term concerns about keto diets, especially the carnivore diet, include the increased risk ofkidney stones,gout, andosteoporosis. Also, the very high protein intake associated with the carnivore diet can lead to impaired kidney function. Because keto diets induce the body to burn fat, all keto diets can jump-start a weight-loss program. But I would never recommend a carnivore diet for this purpose."
Meeting your calorie target,"How can you meet your daily calorie target? One approach is to add up the number of calories per serving of all the foods that you eat, and then plan your menus accordingly. The nutrition labels on all packaged foods and beverages provide calories per serving information. Make a point of reading the labels of the foods and drinks you use, noting the number of calories and the serving sizes. Many recipes published online, in cookbooks, newspapers, and magazines provide similar information. If you hate counting calories, a different approach is to restrict how much and how often you eat, and to eat meals that are low in calories. Dietary guidelines issued by the American Heart Association stress common sense in choosing your foods rather than focusing strictly on numbers, such as total calories or calories from fat. Whichever method you choose, research shows that a regular eating schedule — with meals and snacks planned for certain times each day — makes for the most successful approach. The same applies after you have lost weight and want to keep it off. Sticking with an eating schedule increases your chance of maintaining your new weight. Some people focus on reducing the fat in their eating plan because, at 9 calories per gram, fat by weight contains more than twice as many calories as carbohydrates or proteins (4 calories per gram). However, many people mistakenly think that cutting fat always means cutting calories. Some fat-free foods actually contain more calories than the regular versions because manufacturers use extra sugar to make up for the flavor lost in removing the fat. Moreover, low-fat or nonfat foods are not low-calorie if you consume them in large quantities."
The trouble with visceral fat,"Body fat, or adipose tissue, was once regarded as little more than a storage depot for fat blobs waiting passively to be used for energy. But research has shown that fat cells — particularly visceral fat cells — are biologically active. One of the most important developments [since the mid-1990s] is the realization that the fat cell is an endocrine organ, secreting hormones and other molecules that have far-reaching effects on other tissues. Before researchers recognized that fat acts as an endocrine gland, they thought that the main risk of visceral fat was influencing the production of cholesterol by releasing free fatty acids into the bloodstream and liver. We now know that there's far more to the story. Researchers have identified a host of chemicals that link visceral fat to a surprisingly wide variety of diseases. Subcutaneous fat produces a higher proportion of beneficial molecules, and visceral fat a higher proportion of molecules with potentially deleterious health effects. Visceral fat makes more of the proteins called cytokines, which can trigger low-level inflammation, a risk factor for heart disease and other chronic conditions. It also produces a precursor to angiotensin, a protein that causes blood vessels to constrict and blood pressure to rise."
From fat to disease,"Visceral fat can be measured in a variety of ways. CT scans and full-body MRIs are the most precise, but they are expensive and rarely available, so investigators often use estimates based on waist circumference or waist size in proportion to height (see ""Gut check""). To ensure that they're not just measuring overall obesity, researchers also check whether a person's waist circumference is higher than average for her or his body mass index (BMI). Visceral fat is implicated in a number of chronic conditions, including these: Cardiovascular disease.Several studies have documented this effect. For example, a large study of European women ages 45 to 79 concluded that those with the biggest waists (and those with the largest waists in relation to their hip size) had more than double the risk of developing heart disease. The risk was still nearly double even after adjustment for several other risk factors, including blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, and BMI. Even in healthy, nonsmoking women, every 2 inches of additional waist size raised the risk for cardiovascular disease by 10%. Higher visceral-fat volume also has a deleterious impact on several other heart disease risk factors. It's associated with higher blood pressure, blood sugar levels and triglyceride levels, and lower levels of HDL (good) cholesterol. Taken together, these changes, known as metabolic syndrome, create a serious risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Dementia.Researchers at Kaiser Permanente found that people in their early 40s with the highest levels of abdominal fat, compared with those who had the least abdominal fat at that age, were nearly three times more likely to develop dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) by their mid-70s to early 80s. Dementia was not associated with increased thigh size. Asthma.In a large study of California teachers, women with high levels of visceral fat (a waist circumference of more than 35 inches) were 37% more likely to develop asthma than women with smaller waists — even if their weight was normal. The risks were highest for women who were both large-waisted and overweight or obese. The investigators believe that belly fat raises the risk of asthma more than other poundage because it has inflammatory effects throughout the body, including in the airways. Breast cancer.A combined analysis of several studies found that premenopausal women with abdominal obesity (the largest waist size in proportion to their height) were at greater risk for breast cancer. Large waists were also linked to breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, but that effect was not significant once BMI was taken into account. Colorectal cancer.People with the most visceral fat have three times the risk of developing colorectal adenomas (precancerous polyps) than those with the least visceral fat. The relationship was found after many other risks were accounted for. The researchers also confirmed that adenomatous polyps in the colon are associated with insulin resistance, which may be the mechanism that increases the cancer risk."
How to lose (and prevent) visceral belly fat,"Where you tend to gain fat depends on your genes, your hormones, your age, your birth weight (smaller babies more readily add belly fat later in life), and whether you've had children (women who have given birth tend to develop more visceral fat than women who haven't). As young adults, women on average have less visceral fat than men, but that changes with menopause. You can't change your birth weight or your genes, and you can't hold off menopause. But there are several ways you can minimize the accumulation of visceral fat. The good news is that because it's more readily metabolized into fatty acids, it responds more efficiently to diet and exercise than fat on the hips and thighs. Here are some approaches that may help: Keep moving.Exercise can help reduce your waist circumference. Even if you don't lose weight, you lose visceral belly fat and gain muscle mass. Engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days, such as brisk walking or bicycling at a casual pace. Also create opportunities to add motion to routine tasks. For example, park farther from your destination and walk the rest of the way, take the stairs instead of the elevator, and stand while you talk on the phone. Studies have shown that you can help trim visceral fat or prevent its growth with both aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) and strength training (exercising with weights). Spot exercises, such as sit-ups, can tighten abdominal muscles but won't get at visceral fat. Exercise can also help keep fat from coming back. Eat right.Choose a balanced diet that helps you achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Avoid products that seem to encourage belly fat deposition, especially simple sugars like fructose-sweetened foods and beverages. Don't smoke.The more you smoke, the more likely you are to store fat in your abdomen rather than on your hips and thighs. Get your sleep.Too little is bad. A five-year study found that adults under age 40 who slept five hours or less a night accumulated significantly more visceral fat. But too much isn't good, either — young adults who slept more than eight hours also added visceral fat. (This relationship wasn't found in people over age 40.)

"Stretching nerves, burning calories, and thirst versus hunger","Three top theories are: Feel full, eat less.As noted, filling up on water before meals has intuitive appeal. Your stomach has nerves that sense stretch and send signals to the brain that it's time to stop eating. Presumably, drinking before a meal could send similar signals. Burning off calories.The water we drink must be heated up to body temperature, a process requiring the body to expend energy. The energy spent on this — called thermogenesis — could offset calories from meals. You're not hungry, you're thirsty.This explanation suggests that sometimes we head to the kitchen for something to eat when we're actually thirsty rather than hungry. If that's the case, drinking calorie-free water can save us from consuming unnecessary calories — and that could promote weight loss."
"Exercise booster, no-cal substitution, and burning fat demands water","Being well-hydrated improves exercise capacity and thus weight loss.Muscle fatigue, cramping, and heat exhaustion can all be brought on by dehydration. That's whyextra hydration before exercisemay be recommended, especially for elite athletes exercising in warm environments. Swapping out high calorie drinks with water.Yes, if you usually drink high-calorie beverages (such as sweetened sodas, fruit juice, or alcohol), consistently replacing them with water can aid weight loss over time. Burning fat requires water.Dehydration impairs the body's ability to break down fat for fuel. So, perhaps drinking more water will encourage fat breakdown and, eventually, weight loss."
The bottom line,"So, should you bump up hydration by drinking water before or during meals, or even at other times during the day? Some evidence does suggest thismight aid weight loss, at least for some people. But those studies are mostly small or short-term, or based on animal data. Even positive studies only found modest benefits. That said, if you think it's working for you, there's little downside to drinking a bit more water, other than the challenge of trying to drink if you aren't particularly thirsty. My take? Though plenty of people recommend this approach, it seems based on a theory that doesn't hold water."
What are they?,"The recently FDA-approved anti-obesity medications are in a class called GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s). They mimic a hormone (glucagon-like peptide 1) that helps the body slow stomach emptying, control blood sugar levels, and suppress appetite, a combination that leads to weight loss. One of the drugs, Zepbound, mimics GLP-1 as well as a hormone called a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), believed to promote the effects of GLP-1. ""Many people say these anti-obesity medications have changed their lives,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, an obesity medicine specialist and co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. The drugs also significantly reduce the risk of death from heart-related causes in people with overweight or obesity as well as heart disease (or both heart disease and diabetes, depending on the drug). Plus, they enhance the ability to exercise and boost quality of life. ""The medications may even affect the reward center in the brain, the part that enables you to eat chocolate cake even though you're full. These drugs seem to dampen the reward response, which also may reduce addictive behaviors like cravings for alcohol, sugar, and nicotine,"" Dr. Apovian says."
Wait — aren't they diabetes drugs?,"All three of the anti-obesity drugs were first approved by the FDA just to treat diabetes, under the brand names Ozempic, Victoza, and Mounjaro. But people taking them noticed they were losing substantial amounts of weight. Studies confirmed this effect, and the FDA eventually approved the medications for weight loss, under new brand names: Wegovy, Saxenda, and Zepbound. For overweight or obesity, the drugs are typically prescribed in higher doses than their diabetes counterparts. There are older GLP-1s approved for diabetes, such as dulaglutide (Trulicity), but these treatments have less effect on weight."
How do you take the medications?,"Most of these new drugs come in the form of injections that you give yourself daily or weekly. They are loaded in an injector pen (like an EpiPen for an allergic reaction) that you press against your abdomen or thigh. A pill form of semaglutide (Rybelsus) is also available. It's FDA-approved to treat diabetes, but not yet approved for weight loss. Several other pill formulations are being tested."
What are the side effects?,"Both the anti-obesity and diabetes formulations have potential side effects. Common ones include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or constipation. Dr. Apovian says those tend to go away after a few weeks. In rare cases, the drugs might cause an obstruction in the small bowel, gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), or inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). ""As far as I know, side effects are not permanent. They go away if you stop taking the medications,"" Dr. Apovian says. But the very long-term effects of taking the newer medications are not yet known."""
Who's a candidate for the drugs?,"The drugs are approved for weight loss only in people diagnosed with obesity (a BMI of 30 or greater) or a higher range of overweight (a BMI of 27 to 29.9), as well as a medical problem related to excess weight, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Of course, that hasn't stopped some people who don't meet these criteria from using them. Because these drugs are new and powerful, and are the subject of intense study, it is expected that recommendations as to who should use them will change in the coming years. Researchers are likely to identify new groups of people who might benefit — or, conversely, people who may be at extra risk from drug side effects."
How long do you take the drugs?,"Taking one of the new GLP-1s is not a short-term solution. Once you go on the drug, you must stay on it indefinitely to keep getting the benefits. You regain the weight if you stop taking the medications. ""Overweight and obesity, like diabetes and hypertension, are serious conditions that often require ongoing, even lifelong treatment. There are no 'one-and-done' treatments,"" Dr. Apovian says."
Costs and coverage,"Spectacular results don't come cheaply, and the new drugs range from about $900 to $1,600 per month. Don't expect your insurance to pay for them. Medicare does not cover the anti-obesity medications, and Medicare coverage for the new diabetes drugs is iffy and partial at best, depending on your plan. Private insurance often will pay for the drugs to treat diabetes, as long as you've tried other diabetes treatments without success. But Dr. Apovian says only about 20% to 30% of private insurers currently are covering the anti-obesity formulations. Some manufacturers of GLP-1s offer coupons with steep discounts, but many pharmacies don't accept them. And beware of budget-friendly versions touted in online ads or offered by ""med-spas."" Dr. Apovian says these are compounded (custom-mixed) drugs brought in from other countries, with no oversight by the FDA, and no guarantee of what they contain."
Are they even available?,"To make matters worse, the drugs' frenzied rise in popularity has now caused shortages, making them hard to find. ""The shortage has to do with the manufacturers not anticipating this kind of demand,"" Dr. Apovian says. ""Over 40% of Americans have obesity. The drug companies didn't anticipate how many of them would want to use the medications. The companies are trying desperately to make enough supplies as we speak."" Until they do, and until more insurance companies cover the medications or manufacturers are forced to lower prices (both of which are being debated in Congress), many people with serious medical conditions are finding that they must forgo the most effective anti-obesity drugs we've ever seen.
